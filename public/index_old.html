          <h2 class="mt4 center blue">How Alice works</h2>

          <div class="m2 p2 bg-blue white border rounded">
            <ol class="m0">
              <li class="py1">
                We give you an overview of the different offers from Finnish banks. <br>
                <span class="silver italic">Everything in simple, understandable English.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="py1">
                You can tell us what's important to you and we give you a good recommendation. <br>
                <span class="silver italic">No secret deals with banks. You can click the link and verify the specifications yourself.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="py1">
                You fill in your personal details and upload some required documents. <br>
                <span class="silver italic">We use those only for opening your account. Everything is encrypted, no hacks, no NSA stuff.</span>
              </li>
              <li class="py1">
                We take care of your application for a bank account. <br>
                <span class="silver italic">Paperwork? Proving your student status? Phone calls with the bank? No, you don't have to do a thing. </span>
              </li>
              <li class="py1">
                You choose where you want to pick up your account package. <br>
                <span class="silver italic">We make sure everything is there before your arrival. You just have to show your passport and you're done! </span>
              </li>
              <li class="py1">
                That's it! <br>
                <span class="silver italic">Because you've arranged all this a few months before your arrival, the banks have had enough time to verify that you're not a criminal, so no need to wait for netbanking or other services. </span>
              </li>
            </ol>
